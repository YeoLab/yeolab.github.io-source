## Degrees

BASc. Electrical Engineering: Biomedical Engineering Option, University of British Columbia, 2017
## Summary

Jonathan is a PhD student in the Bioengineering Program at UC San Diego. He graduated from the University of British Columbia in Electrical Engineering with a Biomedical Engineering Specialization and a Minor in Commerce in 2017. During his undergraduate degree, Jonathan worked in Dr. Karen Cheung’s lab developing software for an automated confocal microscopy system and performing image processing for the study of hypoxia in tumor models on microfluidic devices. Jonathan also worked at the Pacific Parkinson’s Research Centre under Dr. Martin McKeown performing real-time digital signal processing with EEG and galvanic skin response data.As a graduate student in the Yeo Lab, Jonathan is interested in developing technologies to target and modify RNA. Broadly, he is focusing on the controlled modulation of alternative splicing ratios, the development of novel and modular RNA binding proteins, and the construction and mathematical modelling of closed-loop RNA targeting circuits. Jonathan is interested in characterizing the input/output relationships of these technologies and automating the process of tailoring them for specific applications. Outside of the lab, he can be found travelling, skiing, hiking, gaming, or reading.
