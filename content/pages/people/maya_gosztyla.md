## Degrees

B.S. Neuroscience and Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State University, 2018<br>

## Summary

Maya received her B.S. in Neuroscience and Molecular Genetics from the Ohio State University. Her honors thesis in Dr. Mark Seeger’s lab focused on polymorphic variants influencing axon guidance in a fruit fly model. She also spent a summer at Dr. Johannes Graff’s lab in Switzerland researching neuronal hyperactivity in an Alzheimer’s disease. After graduating, Maya joined the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) as an NIH Post-Baccalaureate Fellow, where she developed a high-throughput mass spectrometry-based assay to screen drug candidates for lipid storage diseases. Maya then moved to San Diego to join UCSD’s Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program. Her research in the Yeo lab focuses on developing RNA-targeted therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. In her free time, Maya enjoys hiking, cooking, and watching anime.
