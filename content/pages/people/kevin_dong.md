## Degrees
B.S., Psychobiology, University of California, Los Angeles, 2016

## Summary
A Southern California native all his life, Kevin graduated from UCLA in 2016 with a B.S. in Psychobiology. During his time there, he worked in the laboratory of Drs. Frank Pajonk and Erina Vlashi to further understand glioma and breast cancer stem cells in the context of radiobiology. Kevin has returned back to San Diego and is now an SRA1 in the Yeo Lab where he is working on exploiting the therapeutic potential of Cas9 at the RNA level. He is also on a project focused on RBP discovery. Guided by his positive experiences in the lab along with the ample support from his research mentors, Kevin aspires to become a physician-scientist with the hope of making advances in the field of neural stem cell biology to change the paradigm of how stroke, brain injury, GBM, and neurodevelopmental disease are treated.

When he is not pipetting in the lab, Kevin enjoys surfing, lifting, and eating Mexican food.
