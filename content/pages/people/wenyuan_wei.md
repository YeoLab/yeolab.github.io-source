## Summary

Andy is a Master’s student in Biomedical Engineering program (BME) in UCSD. He received his B.S. degree in Microbiology, Immunology and Molecular Genetics from UCLA in 2018. In college he worked in Dr. Chentao Lin’s lab in Arabidopsis protein BIC1 & CIB1 evolution using phage-assisted continuous evolution (PACE). During the first year of graduate school, Andy worked in Dr. Yingxiao Wang’s lab, mainly focusing on calibrating the basal responsiveness of an engineered heat-shock biosensor. 

In Yeo lab, Andy is currently working on developing a 3-D cell culture model to simulate conditions observed in patients with Alzheimer’s disease; in particular, he is aiming to detect aggregation of certain pathological proteins both intracellularly and extracellularly. Broadly he is interested in protein engineering, pathology and cell biology. Toxoplasma gondii is somehow his favorite microorganism.
