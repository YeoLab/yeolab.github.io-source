## Summary

Eric is a PhD student in UCSD's Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (BISB) program. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in computer science, Eric jumped on the Silocon Valley bandwagon and worked for three years as a software engineer at Fabric Genomics, a genomic diagnostics startup in Oakland. He spent the next two years as a bioinformatics research associate in Eli Van Allen's clinical computational oncology lab at Dana Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in Boston, before moving to San Diego in 2019 for graduate school. Eric is generally interested in studying the epigenetic and epitranscriptomic mechanisms regulating microglial biology, both in the context of normal development and in neurodegenerative diseases. When he does manage to peel his eyes aways from the screen, Eric likes to spend his time surfing, training for and racing in triathlons with UCSD's Tri team, painting, and playing guitar.
