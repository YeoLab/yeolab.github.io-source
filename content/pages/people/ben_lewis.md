## Summary
Ben is a PhD student in the Biology program at the University of California, San Diego. Ben received his B.S. in 2013, doubling majoring in Biochemistry and Microbiology from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo where he continued on to earn his M.S. in Biology with a specialization in Stem Cell Research as part of the CIRM Bridges to Stem Cell Research Awards program.  During his master’s degree, he carried out his CIRM-funded Research Internship at the Salk Institute in the Laboratory of Inder Verma where he took part in several CRISPR genome editing projects involving various patient-derived iPSC models. As a graduate student at UCSD, he is generally interested in cell biology and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins. In particular he is interested the biological functions and mechanisms of localized translation. He is co-mentored by Tony Hunter and Gene Yeo. The mitochondria are his favorite organelles.
