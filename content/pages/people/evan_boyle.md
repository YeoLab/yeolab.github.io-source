## Summary

Evan fulfilled a double major in Biochemistry and Microbiology at the University of Washington in Seattle. As an undergraduate, he learned the fundamentals of molecular biology in the Biochemistry department before transitioning to the lab of Dr. Jay Shendure lab in the Department of Genome Sciences. There he worked on new methods for DNA sequencing by molecular inversion probes and, after graduating, on multiplex genome editing using CRISPR. During his graduate studies and under the co-supervision of Dr. Jonathan Pritchard and Dr. William Greenleaf, Evan characterized the polygenicity of complex traits, biases in high-throughput genetic screening data, and the DNA-binding specificity of Cas9. His work includes proposing the ‘omnigenic model’ for complex traits and adapting the radioactive filter binding assay to a nonradioactive, sequencing-based readout. While at Stanford, Evan also completed Stanford Medical School’s Masters of Medicine program, designed to expose PhD students to the field of medicine. As a postdoctoral researcher in the Yeo lab, Evan is interested in linking RNA-binding proteins to functional targets and developing new technologies for perturbing RNA processing in human cells.
