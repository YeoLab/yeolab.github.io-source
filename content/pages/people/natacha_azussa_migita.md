## Summary

Natacha Migita is a visiting PhD student in Genetics and Molecular Biology Program from Campinas University, Sao Paulo, Brazil. Japanese descendant, Natacha was born and raised in Brazil. Her master’s thesis focused on studying stress granules and RNAs-targets of Caprin-1, a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein. As a graduate student, Natacha is interested in identify novel genetic abnormalities (fusion genes) associated with biological characteristic and clinical features in pediatric patients with leukemia. Also, she wants to study resistance to chemotherapy and ABL kinase inhibitors. In Dr Yeo’s lab, Natacha wants to explore the role played by cellular stress responses in TKI resistance by leukemia. In her free time, Natacha is enjoying the San Diego city and regions around.
