## Summary

Enching Luo received her master degree in Physiology from National Taiwan University. In her master studies, she worked in bioinformatics and biostatistics core laboratory. Her master thesis focused on microRNA regulation for breast cancer. Before starting graduate studies in Bioengineering at UC San Diego, Enching was a research assistance in biomaterial laboratory at National Tsing Hua University. She constructed metastasis colon cancer model on mice to study drug delivery. As a bioengineering graduate student at UCSD, Enching is interested in RNA regulation and genomics. Enching is funded by Taiwanese government.
