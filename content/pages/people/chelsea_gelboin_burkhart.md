B.A., Molecular and Cellular Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology, University of California at Berkeley, 2013<br>

## Summary
Chelsea began her scientific journey far far away at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences, when she was a wee high school student. Working in the Gage Lab, she became an expert at maxi prepping, making virus and being a bio nerd. Chelsea graduated high school and flew north where she worked in Russell Vance's lab at UC Berkeley, learning that there is more to life than the brain, we have intestines! Still, studying the microbiome was not enough to pull Chelsea away from the field, and she graduated with a BA in Molecular and Cellular Biology with an emphasis in Neurobiology. She moved back down to sunny San Diego and joined the Yeo lab as a technician where she became an expert pippetter and learned to never fear RNA. She began working primarily with Eric Van Nostrand on a project to elucidate the effects of RNA binding proteins on splicing and is now working on the ENCODE team to find novel RNAs bound by many many RBPs. Chelsea hopes to continue onto medical school where she will be able to apply her pipetting skills to real live people. 

In her free time, Chelsea enjoys salsa dancing, playing with her furry children (Lilah and Oliver - canine and feline respectively), singing loudly while driving, and refusing to pay her parking tickets.
