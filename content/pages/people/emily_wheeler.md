## Summary

Emily is a PhD student in the Biomedical Science Department at UCSD and a member of the genetics training program. Her thesis work in Gene Yeo’s lab focuses on using computational and molecular biology tools to uncover how protein-RNA interactions in cells play a role in cancer and neurodegeneration. Specifically, she is working on uncovering novel RNA binding proteins that are essential to form protein-aggregates in motor neurons that cause cell death in ALS. Additionally, she is developing computational methods to determine how point mutations in splicing factors that occur in blood cancer alter their interaction with cellular RNA. The results of this work will lead to a greater understanding of how these deadly diseases form, and therefore help design therapeutics to reverse the disease. 

Emily received her undergraduate degree from Indiana University where she completed a senior honors thesis on RNA editing in C. elegans in the lab of Dr. Heather Hundley. Emily is an NSF GRFP fellow and has received funding from the UCSD Genetics Training Program. She has also been an ARCS scholar since 2017. Emily developed and implemented a new course in computational methods that has been included in the core curriculum for the BMS graduate program at UCSD. She also served as the lead bioinformatics instructor for the Cold Spring Harbor course in Single Cell Analyses in 2018. Emily is also a tutor for the Reality Changers program in San Diego working with high school students who will become the first members of their family to attend college. Outside of lab, Emily spends her time in the mountains skiing during the winter months and climbing in the summer.
