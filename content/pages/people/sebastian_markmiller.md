## Summary

Sebastian received his B.S. in Molecular Biotechnology in 2004 and his M.S. in Molecular and Cell Biology in 2006 from the University of Heidelberg, Germany. After having worked with various vertebrate developmental model systems, including drosophila, medaka and zebrafish at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) during his masters degree, he moved to Melbourne, Australia, to join the lab of Dr. Joan Heath at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR). During his graduate studies he cloned and characterized a novel zebrafish mutant with defects in endodermal organ development caused by a deficiency in the U12-type splicing factor rnpc3. Using a combination of biochemistry and genome-wide gene expression analysis, his works presents the first characterization of defective U12-type splicing on a genome-wide scale, proposes additional functions for rnpc3 in the U12-type spliceosome and describes the first link between U12-type splicing deficiency and human cancer. In the Yeo lab, Sebastian, continues to study mRNA processing, but now focuses on the link between mRNA metabolism and neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). He also has a keen interest in implementing innovative methods such as metabolic labeling of mRNA and genetic engineering with TALE nucleases.
