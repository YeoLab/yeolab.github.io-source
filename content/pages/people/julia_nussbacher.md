## Degrees

Sc.B Biochemistry, Brown University, 2010<br>

## Summary

Julia Nussbacher received her undergraduate degree in Biochemistry from Brown University. While at Brown, Julia completed a thesis project in the lab of Dr. Anatoly Zhitkovich in the department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. She used a lung cancer model to study the role of mismatch repair proteins in the development of chemotherapeutic resistance to DNA crosslinking compounds. As an undergraduate, Julia also gained experience in the biotech industry. She interned two summers at Achaogen, performing bacterial assays to determine dose response, as well as synthesizing novel antibiotics to counter bacterial resistance. She also interned at Affymetrix in Assay and Application Development where she worked to design and optimize a new genotyping protocol. Before beginning graduate studies in biomedical sciences at the UC San Diego School of Medicine, Julia worked in research and development for Pathwork Diagnostics, which performs an array-based in vitro diagnostic test to determine tumor tissue of origin.
