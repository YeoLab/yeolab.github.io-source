Ph.D. Chemical Biology, University of Michigan, 2018<br>

## Summary

Daniel received his B.S. in Biochemistry from Sonoma State University in 2013. While at the college, he worked in Dr. Jon Fukuto’s laboratory to understand the mechanism of hydrogen sulfide signaling. Daniel also spent time working in Dr. Brian Kennedy’s lab at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging. There, he studied membrane fluidity and chemotaxis in both yeast and C. elegans. After graduating, Daniel joined Dr. Amanda Garner’s Lab at the University of Michigan and obtained his Ph.D. in Chemical Biology in 2018. His thesis research focused on developing new technologies to facilitate the targeting of RNA and RNA binding proteins with small molecules. With these new assays, Daniel conducted two high-throughput screening campaigns, totaling over 200,000 compounds, that resulted in the discovery of several unique scaffolds. Now a member of the Yeo lab, Daniel is interested in uncovering the biological functions of various RNA modifications and understanding RNA localization.
