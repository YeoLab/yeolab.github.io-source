## Summary

As an undergraduate at UC Berkeley Anne worked in the lab of Dr. Peggy Lemaux on a projected funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation aiming to improve the nutritional quality of sorghum plants. With a desire to study human biology and cancer she moved to UCLA for two years in the lab of Amander Clark studying germ cell development and tumor formation using mammalian stem cells. Anne moved to UC San Diego for graduate school with the aim to further develop her expertise in human development and tumorigenesis using stem cells as a model system. Her research in the Yeo Lab uses CLIP-seq and RNA-seq to study regulation by RNA-binding proteins and their roles in cancer and human development. Anne participated in the Genetics Training Program and completed her PhD in the Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program in 2014.
