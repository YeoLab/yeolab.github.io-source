## Summary

Yan Song came to the United States for her graduate career in 2003 after she received her MD from School of Medicine in Peking University, China. She obtained Ph.D. in Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology from Stony Brook University (aka New York State University at Stony Brook), New York in 2009 with Dr. Howard Crawford. Her graduate work focused on transcriptional network and cell signaling in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, using pancreatic cancer as the model disease. She identified two transcription factors, FOXA1 and FOXA2 as essential repressors of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through their favorable regulation of E-cadherin in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that loss of FOXA1/2 signaling is a key event in inducing EMT program. In a second project, she demonstrated that a major transcription factor essential for embryonic development plays a critical role in tissue regeneration after wounding as well as tumorigenesis, using a combination of an inducible Pdx-1 knock out mouse model and a pancreatitis model. In Dr. Yeoâ€™s lab, she is interested in understanding how RNA binding protein and RNA regulation engage in the regulatory network to direct the cell fate decision and the functionality of the cells.
