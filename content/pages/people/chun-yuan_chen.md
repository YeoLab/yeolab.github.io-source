## Degrees
Ph.D. in Biological Engineering, University of Southern California, 2016<br>M.S in Cell and Molecular Biology, Taipei Medical University/ Academia Sinica, 2006 <br>B.S. in Marine Resources, National Sun Yat-Sen University, 2004<br>

## Summary
Elliot received his B.S. in in Marine Resources from National Sun Yat-Sen University and his M.S. in Cell and Molecular Biology from Taipei Medical University in Taiwan. As a master student, he conducted his research with Dr. Chwan-Deng Hsiao’s laboratory at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan focusing on deciphering the structure and the function of the nucleocapid protein of SARS coronavirus. After he briefly worked as a research assistant at the Academia Sinica, Elliot joined Dr. Deborah Johnson’s laboratory at the University of Southern California, the lab was moved to the Baylor College of Medicine in 2014, where he received his doctorate degree. During his graduate studies, he identified novel roles of Maf1, a transcription repressor, and RNA pol III-mediated transcription in embryonic stem cell differentiation and adipogenesis. As a postdoc researcher in the Yeo lab, Elliot is interested in understanding the roles of small noncoding RNAs and their interacting RNA binding proteins in cellular differentiation and neurodegenerative diseases.
