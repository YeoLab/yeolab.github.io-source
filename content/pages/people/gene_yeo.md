## Summary

Gene Yeo PhD MBA is a Professor of Cellular and Molecular Medicine at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). Dr. Yeo has a BSc in Chemical Engineering and a BA in Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, a Ph.D. in Computational Neuroscience (Machine Learning) from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an MBA from the UCSD Rady School of Management. Gene’s research interest is in understanding and manipulating RNA processing in development and disease using induced pluripotent stem cell and animal models. Gene’s lab develops and utilizes multidisciplinary technologies ranging from machine learning, biochemistry, molecular biology, genomics, chemistry and materials research. Gene is widely collaborative and emphasizes on reproducibility and robustness in his data and results, and transparency and honesty in communicating with trainees and colleagues. Dr. Yeo has authored more than 160 peer-reviewed publications including invited book chapters and review articles in the areas of neurodegeneration, RNA processing, computational biology and stem cell models; and served as Editor on two books on the biology of RNA binding proteins. Recently, his lab developed enhanced CLIP for the purposes of large-scale mapping of protein-RNA interactions. His lab also demonstrated in vivo RNA targeting with CRISPR/Cas proteins with proof of concept in repeat expansion disorders. Gene is on the Editorial Boards of the journals Cell Reports and Cell Research. Gene joined UCSD as an Assistant Professor in 2008, was promoted with tenure to Associate Professor in 2014 and to Professor in 2016. Gene was the first Crick-Jacobs Fellow at the Salk Institute (2005-2008) and is a recipient of the Alfred P Sloan Fellowship in recognition of his work in computational molecular biology (2011), Singapore National Research Foundation Visiting Investigatorship Award (2017), the inaugural Early Career Award from the International RNA Society (2017), a Blavatnik National Award Finalist (2018) and San Diego Xconomy Award Finalist (2019). Gene’s research has been funded by the National Institute of Health, National Science Foundation, California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, TargetALS, ALS Foundation, Department of Defense, Myotonic Dystrophy Association, Myotonic Dystrophy Foundation and Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. Gene is a co-founder of biotech companies which includes Locana, Eclipse Bioinnovations, Enzerna and Proteona. Gene serves or had served on the scientific advisory boards of the Allen Institute of Immunology, Locana, Eclipse Bioinnovations, Proteona, Aquinnah, Cell Applications, Nugen and Ribometrix.
