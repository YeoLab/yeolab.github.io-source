Ph.D. in Biomedical Science & Engineering, University of Maine, 2018   



## Summary
Kathy Morelli received her B.S. in Biological Science from the University of Vermont in 2011. As an undergraduate she worked in the laboratory of Dr. Rae Nishi, where she helped develop novel immunotherapies for patients with neuroblastoma. After graduating, Kathy joined Dr. Robert Burgess’s laboratory at The Jackson Laboratory, where she earned a Ph.D. through a cooperative graduate program with the University of Maine. Under a NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein NRSA Predoctoral Fellowship, awarded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, she developed novel gene therapy approaches for rare and orphan neuromuscular disorders. Specifically, her dissertation focused on developing therapeutic strategies for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). This disease represents a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of inherited peripheral neuropathies, all of which are currently incurable. She engineered RNAi-based, personalized gene therapies for patients with dominant forms of CMT, while identifying genetic modifiers of CMT—findings with implications for the diagnosis and prognosis of CMT, and the development of novel treatment strategies. https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/2018/august/kathy-morelli-finding-cures-for-rare-diseases Now, as a President’s Postdoctoral Fellow in the Yeo lab, Kathy is interested in translating novel gene therapy approaches for neurological disorders caused by microsatellite repeat expansions for potential clinical use. She is also interested in understanding the impact of RNA metabolism on neuronal and synaptic homeostasis in the context of neurological diseases such as autism spectrum disorders and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
