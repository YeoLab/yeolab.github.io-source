## Degrees

M.D. from Taipei Medical University, 2019<br>

## Summary

Hsuan-lin is interested in discovering new biological mechanisms by combining sequencing data, evolutionary information with models and algorithms. In her undergraduate research, she found some hypothetical proteins that are involved in the antibiotic resistance. Then she integrated multiple information such as co-evolution, protein-protein interaction to probe these proteinsâ€™ function. In grad school, she will continue her search for novel functions in RNA-binding proteins.<br>
