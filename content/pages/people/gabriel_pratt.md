## Degrees

B.S Computer Science, University of Washington 2011<br>

## Summary

Gabriel Pratt received his B.S. in [Computer Science] (http://www.cs.washington.edu/) from the University of Washington in 2011.  During his undergraduate career he had the opportunity to learn bioinformatcs in the labs of [Chuck Murry](http://www.pathology.washington.edu/research/labs/murry/), [Martin Tompa](http://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/tompa/) and [John Stamatoyannopoulos](http://www.gs.washington.edu/faculty/stamj.htm).  His projects focused on microarray and high-throughput sequence analysis with a specific focus on epigenetic regulation of cardiovascular differentiation.  As a summer intern at Microsoft he learned software engineering and techniques to analyze big data.  Additionally he spent a year in the in Japan working with Dr. [Yasunori Aizawa](http://www.bio.titech.ac.jp/english/information/en_grad/ls/ls-05_e-aizawa.html) at [Tokyo Institute of Technology](http://www.titech.ac.jp/english/) studying functional upstream open reading frames.  As a graduate student Gabriel is broadly interested in understanding protein-RNA interactions.  Specifically understanding how combinations of RNA binding proteins influence splicing and how that regulates RNA translation and stalling. Gabriel is funded by the NSF GRFP.
