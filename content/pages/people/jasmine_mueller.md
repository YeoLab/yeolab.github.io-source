## Degrees
B.S., Chemistry emphasis in Biochemistry, Humboldt State University. 

## Summary
Originally from Oceanside, I transfered to Humboldt State University to study Chemistry. After working on different chemistry projects, I switched my focus to Cellular and Molecular Biology. From there I started researching with Dr. John Steele investigating the knockdown and activation of the HEXB gene using different CRISPR-Cas9 methods. In addition, I have worked with Dr. Amy Sprowels investigating the relationship between Cjun and Oct4 interactions and their effect on cardiomyocytes differentation in murine embryonic stem cells. To further my scientific diversity, I now work on the Encode project with Steven Blue. My goals are to gather more knowledge about the Cellular and Molecular biology before returning to stem cell research. In my free time, I love to cook for others, swim, and hike.
