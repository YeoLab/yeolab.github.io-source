## Summary

Josh graduated magna cum laude with majors in Biology and Chemistry from Transylvania University. As an undergraduate student at a small liberal arts school, Josh supplemented his academic training with summer biomedical research projects at the University of Cincinnati, Brown University, and Stanford University, where he studied tissue-specific gene expression, electrophysiological properties of ion channels, and neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Upon graduation, Josh enrolled in the Biochemistry, Cellular, and Molecular Biology graduate program at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to study the regulation of neuronal gene expression. As a National Science Foundation (NSF) graduate research fellow, Josh studied how the evolutionarily conserved Let-7 family of miRNAs regulate neuronal growth and synaptic plasticity. Answering this question led him to the laboratory of Narry Kim at Seoul National University in Korea, where Josh, funded by NSF's Graduate Research Opportunities Worldwide program, learned to perform next generation sequencing with TAIL-seq to determine if genes targeted by Let-7 miRNA are differentially polyadenylated or "tailed" in response to stimulation by brain-derived neuronal growth factor. Now, as a member of Gene Yeo's lab, Josh is continuing to investigate the cellular and molecular basis of brain development, focusing on controls of neuronal protein synthesis in health and diseases like autism spectrum disorders.
