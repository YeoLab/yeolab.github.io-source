B.S. Biopsychology, University of California Santa Barbara, 2017

## Summary

Alex is a Ph.D student in the Biomedical Sciences program at University of California, San Diego. Previously, she received her B.S. in Biopsychology from the University of California, Santa Barbara where she participated in a variety of research opportunities in the labs of Dr. Zach Ma, Dr. Michael Miller and Dr. Hillary Young. She also spent a summer in the lab of Dr. Liwen Jiang at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. After graduating, Alex spent two years in the lab of Dr. Jayanta Debnath in the UCSF Department of Pathology where she studied the role of selective autophagy in the regulation of tumor cell plasticity, differentiation and metastasis.  During this time, she developed an interest in the role of gene expression in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis. In the Yeo lab, Alex is excited to be working with a talented group and is focused on developing techniques for measuring mRNA translation in cancer models.
