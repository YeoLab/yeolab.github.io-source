## Summary
Wenhao received his B.S. in Bioinformatics from Zhejiang University in 2014. As an undergraduate with Dr. Chen Xin, he worked on next-generation sequencing data analysis and equipped himself with machine learning skill set as well. Wenhao also spent time working in Dr. Du Jizeng’s lab to understand the roles of phosphorylation of APQ4 in cerebral edema. After graduating, Wenhao joined Dr. Gene Yeo’s lab at National University of Singapore to pursue a PhD, where he developed a machine learning approach to recognize RNA-binding proteins with high sensitivity and specificity. This approach leverages the information from protein-protein interaction network and protein sequences and is further demonstrated to have fair predictive power for more specific RNA-binding information (i.e. RNA-binding domains or regions) without explicit training data. Now as a member in the Yeo Lab at UCSD, Wenhao is interested in combining machine learning and statistical techniques with large biomedical dataset to interrogate important biological patterns underpinning human diseases.
