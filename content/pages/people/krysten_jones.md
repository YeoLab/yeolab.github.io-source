## Degrees
B.S. in Biological Sciences, California Polytechnic State University, SLO 2014  

## Summary

Krysten received her bachelor's degree in Biological Sciences with a concentration in Anatomy and Physiology at California Polytechnic State University (Cal Poly) in 2014. She is currently participating in the Regenerative Medicine program also at Cal Poly as a Biological Sciences MS candidate. During her time at Cal Poly, she worked in the lab of Sandra Clement, PhD researching protein-protein associations of RNA binding protein Tristetraprolin (TTP) aka zinc finger protein 36 homolog (ZFP36). 



Krysten is currently an intern in the Yeo lab at UCSD where she will be working under Stefan Aigner, PhD and Ryan Marina. Here, she is studying the effects of glutamine repeats (polyQ) in the ataxia-2 gene on spinal cerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using CRISPR technology to create polyQ mutations in iPSCs. These cells will then be differentiated to motor neurons so the polyQ repeat effects can be further studied "in vitro".
