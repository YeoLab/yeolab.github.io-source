## Summary
Clarence is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program (BISB) at UCSD. He received a B.S. in Bioengineering: Bioinformatics from UCSD in 2016. During his undergraduate research, he worked with Dr. Terry Gaasterland to study transcriptional regulators of peroxisome biogenesis disorders via motif analysis. After graduation, he continued to pursue research with Dr. Jill Mesirov in the UCSD School of Medicine where he integrated multi-omic analyses to characterize tumor heterogeneity in medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. Alongside research, he developed reproducible bioinformatics workflows utilizing the GenePattern genomics tool platform. Working with a wide array of tools and pipelines led him to realize the importance of reproducible research. Clarence is currently jointly advised by Dr. Yeo and Dr. Hannah Carter in the UCSD School of Medicine and is interested in the regulation of alternative splicing in the context of neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Outside of the lab, Clarence enjoys swimming, exploring good food and coffee, hanging out with his dog and playing the piano.
