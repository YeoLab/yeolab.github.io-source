## Degrees

B.S. Neurobiology, University of Wisconsin Madison, 2016<br>

## Summary

Sammi is a Ph.D. student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at UCSD and received a B.S. in Neurobiology from the University of Wisconsin Madison. At UW-Madison, she worked in the lab of Dr. Kate O’Connor-Giles where she studied the genetic regulators of synaptic function using CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering of the fruit fly. After graduating, Sammi worked as a lab technician in the lab of Dr. Allison Ebert at the Medical College of Wisconsin. At MCW, she studied a variety of neurological diseases including Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Parkinson’s disease, ALS, Huntington’s disease, and human cytomegalovirus using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived astrocyte, neuronal, and organoid models. As a Ph.D. student at UCSD, Sammi joined the lab of Dr. Gene Yeo to study RNA metabolism in Huntington’s disease using iPSC based neuronal models. As an undergrad, Sammi received the Hilldale Undergraduate Research Fellowship for her research in Dr. O’Connor-Giles’ lab, and currently isan NSF GRFP fellow. In addition to her research, Sammi volunteers through the Neuroscience Outreach Program at UCSD where she teaches the community about neuroscience and what it is like to be a scientist.
