## Summary
Jason Nathanson received his B.S. and Ph.D. in [Bioengineering](http://be.ucsd.edu/) from the University of California San Diego in 2001 and 2008, respectively. For his graduate studies, he trained in the labs of Dr. [Edward Callaway](http://www.salk.edu/faculty/callaway.html) and Dr. [Fred Gage](http://www.salk.edu/faculty/gage.html) at the [Salk Institute](http://www.salk.edu/) for Biological Studies. In Dr. Callaway's lab, Dr. Nathanson developed tools to study brain circuitry and advance gene therapy by creating viruses aimed at targeting subtypes of inhibitory neurons in mammals. He designed and tested multiple short promoter designs in viruses, including promoter sequences evolutionarily conserved among mammals and co-expressed genes; sequences derived from genes evolutionarily conserved in the puffer fish Fugu rubripes; and minimalist promoter sequences assembled from transcription factor building blocks.  In Dr. Gage's lab, Dr. Nathanson used laser capture microdissection in combination with DNA microarrays to profile gene expression in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. This work focused on identifying the transcriptional signatures among the diverse cell types that contribute to the neurogenic nature of this region. Dr. Nathanson is now studying the roles of coding and non-coding RNAs expressed in the stem cell niche. Using RNA cloning and high-throughput sequencing, he is identifying RNAs expressed in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, as well as their differentiated progeny.
