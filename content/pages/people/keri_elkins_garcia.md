## Degrees
B.S., Biology, San Diego State University, 2012<br>

## Summary
As an undergraduate student at San Diego State University, Keri was part of Dr. Elizabeth Dinsdale's Microbial Ecology lab where she gained exposure to bioinformatic and sequencing techniques of microbiomes from around the world. During her last year at SDSU she was awarded a grant from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine to carry out stem cell research in the lab of Dr. Inder Verma at the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences. In Dr. Verma's lab she focused on epigenetic gene regulation in pluripotent and differentiating stem cells. After receiving her bachelor's degree in Biology in 2012 she joined Dr. Gene Yeo's group to study neurological disorders using stem cell models. Keri's current project is to help uncover binding sites of RNA binding proteins by using cross-link immunoprecipitation (CLIP) techniques.
