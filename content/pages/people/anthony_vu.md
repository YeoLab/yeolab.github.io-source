B.S., Biochemistry: Cell Biology, University of California, San Diego, 2008<br>

## Summary
Anthony Vu received his B.S. in Biochemistry: Cell Biology from the UCSD in 2008. He earned his M.S. degree a year later from UCSD working in Dr. Fred H. Gage's lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies where he characterized the nuclear and cytoplasmic roles of the transcription factor REST in hESC and hESC derived human NPCs. Currently, as a staff associate in Dr. Gene Yeo's lab, Anthony works on investigating the roles of RNA binding proteins in neurodegenerative diseases using human iPSCs.
