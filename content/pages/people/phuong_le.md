## Summary

Phuong Le received her B.S. and M.S. in Biological Systems Engineering from the University of California at Davis, where she developed a label-free imaging method to detect oxidative stress in microbes under the guidance of Dr. Nitin. In PhD, Phuong joined Dr. Andrew Smith in the Bioengineering department at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Phuong’s thesis focuses on developing quantitative, single-molecule imaging techniques and nanotechnology probes called quantum dots to observe and quantify individual molecules in cells. Using this technological platform, Phuong studied decision-making process of single cells in pathogenesis states including cancer and inflammation. As a postdoctoral researcher in Yeo lab, Phuong plans to gain training in computational neuroscience. Phuong is interested in studying how neurons function in homeostasis and pathogenesis states. In particular, Phuong wants to explore RNA localization in the context of neurodegenerative diseases. Phuong has competed in national competitions in table tennis and chess.
