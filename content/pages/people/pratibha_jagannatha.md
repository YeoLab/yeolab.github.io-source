## Summary

Pratibha is a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Systems Biology Program at University of California, San Diego. She received her bachelor of science degree in Biomolecular Engineering and a minor in Bioinformatics from the University of California, Santa Cruz. Throughout her undergraduate career, she conducted research in Dr. Angela Brooks and Dr. Susan Carpenter’s labs where she studied the role of alternative splicing in the innate immune response and developed an interest in RNA biology, immunology, and computational biology. During her time at UCSC, she also had the opportunity to co-captain UCSC’s 2017 iGEM (international genetically engineered machine) team under the mentorship of Dr. David Bernick and explore the field of synthetic biology. As a part of UCSC iGEM, Pratibha and her team aimed to develop a reliable, self-sufficient, and cost-effective method of manufacturing essential medicines and supplements in cyanobacteria to benefit communities that struggle with reliable access to such resources.<br>

As a PhD student in the Yeo Lab, Pratibha continues to explore her interest in RNA Biology and is looking to use long-read sequencing to better understand the relationship between the mRNA and protein landscape. Outside of the lab, Pratibha enjoys singing, dancing, and spending time with friends and family.<br>
