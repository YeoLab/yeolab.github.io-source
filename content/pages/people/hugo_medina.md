## Summary

Hugo is a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine (CMM) at UC San Diego. He earned a Ph.D. in Biochemistry from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 2020. Under the supervision of Dr. Marvin Wickens, he created a method to capture transcriptome-wide records of RNA-site interactions in living cells. Hugo’s graduate training ignited an interest in RNA biology. As a UC San Diego Institutional Research and Academic Career Development Awards (IRACDA) fellow in the Yeo Lab, Hugo is interested in uncovering the links between RNA intermolecular interactions and disease.   

Before his graduate training, Hugo completed a B.A. in Biology at California State University, Northridge. During his undergraduate training, Hugo researched bacterial morphology and physiology in the laboratory of Dr. Michael L. Summers. In 2010, he traveled to the Leloir Foundation Institute in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to study bacterial pathogenesis in the laboratory of Dr. Angeles Zorreguieta.
