## Summary
I am currently pursuing a BS in Cell and Molecular Biology at San Diego State University and am working with my mentor Joshua Schwartz, PhD to study how copy number variations in chromosomes play a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Iâ€™ve been using CRISPR-Cas9 technology to introduce mutations in human pluripotent stem cells that are commonly seen in patients with ASD in order to identify how these mutations may alter neuron development. As a CIRM (Bridges to Stem Cell Research) intern, my goals are to further engage in the world of regenerative medicine using iPSCs as a tool to  model these diseases and find novel therapies. In my free time I love to craft, skateboard, and explore!
