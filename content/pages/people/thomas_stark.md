## Summary

Thomas previously worked in [Guy Benian](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/GMB/faculty.html)'s laboratory at [Emory University](http://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), studying assembly and maintenance of the muscle contractile apparatus in Caenorhabditis elegans. He also spent a summer in the lab of [Alex Andrianopoulos](http://www.hhmi.org/research/scholars/andrianopoulos_bio.html) at the [University of Melbourne in Australia](http://www.unimelb.edu.au/), which involved analysis of the human pathogen Penicillium marneffei and its ability to alternate between a unicellular and multicellular form. As a graduate student, Thomas is interested in taking a closer look at virus-host interactions with respect to RNA-binding proteins. As part of a collaboration with the Spector lab at UCSD, he plans to initiate these studies using large-scale sequencing methods. Additionally, Thomas is interested in studying elements that allow for productive viral infection of permissive host cell types. Thomas is supported by the [Genetics Training Grant](http://genetics.ucsd.edu/financial.html) at UCSD.
