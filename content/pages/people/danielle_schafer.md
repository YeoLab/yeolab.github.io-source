## Summary
Danielle is a PhD student in the Biomedical Sciences Program at UC San Diego. While pursuing her undergraduate degree at Northern Michigan University, she was a researcher in the Upper Michigan Brain Tumor Center and studied extracellular vesicle release in immortalized glioblastoma cell lines. After graduation, Danielle moved to New Zealand to pursue a Master of Science in Neuroscience under the mentorship of Allan Herbison and Richard Piet. Her thesis focused on neurotransmitter regulation of kisspeptin neurons, and uncovered novel sub-region and sex-specific differences. After completing her masters, Danielle moved to UC San Diego to continue her work in reproductive neuroendocrinology in Alexander (Sasha) Kauffmanâ€™s laboratory. 

As a PhD student Danielle is broadly interested in post-transcriptional mechanisms in neurodevelopment, as well as the role of sex differences in susceptibility to neurological disorders. She is co-mentored by Gene Yeo and Nicole Coufal, and is focused on post-transcriptional mechanisms governing microglia function in neurodevelopment. Outside of the lab, she enjoys running, climbing, and coffee.
